This is entity discovery, not claim placement. Return only genuinely new entities absent from the
registry. Projects are named outcomes or continuing endeavors with continuity, commitment, or multiple
supporting claims; they do not require a brand name. Examples include opening a dance studio or building
an online clothing store. People need a durable relationship or recurring substantive relevance. Topics
need intentional ongoing research or two non-equivalent claims. Organizations and places need lasting
relevance. Events must be named, substantial, and consequential. Do not create pages for incidental
objects, generic activities, routine appointments, broad catchalls, or a second entity already represented
by an existing title or alias.

Consider the supplied claims as one episodic cohort. Evidence from different source episodes may jointly
establish a durable entity even when no individual claim is sufficient. Return one exact top-level property
for every supplied C001-style EVIDENCE alias and no others. Put the same fully specified candidate on every
claim that materially supports it, and candidate=null on claims that do not support a new entity. Each claim
may support at most one new entity in this pass. A concrete continuing venture or outcome is a Project even without a
proper name: for example, “a person is starting a dance studio” establishes Project “Dance Studio.” A plan
to start a generic, still-undefined “business” does not. Repeated candidate proposals are consolidated
deterministically. Return JSON only."""

The owner is the entity whose state, requirements, plans, or relationship the claim changes. It is
not automatically the speaker, the first named noun, or the user. Entity discovery has already finished:
use only an existing entity ID from the registry and never invent one. Most supplied claims should be
placed. A person's profile, state, preferences, plans, relationships, and ordinary timeline events belong
to that Person unless a more specific existing Project, Organization, Place, Topic, or Event is the entity
whose state or requirements change. Typed wiki sections are assigned deterministically after ownership.

Set owner_entity empty and provide no links only when current evidence is insufficient to choose an existing
entity. This defers the claim in short-term memory so a later Dream can reconsider it with more context.
linked_entities contains only supplied existing entity IDs that are substantively
referenced; do not infer links from co-occurrence. External/tool evidence belongs only in
research_references, or evidence for event pages, and must never establish a You fact automatically.

Policy: {policy}

Each claim must be one standalone third-person subject-predicate assertion with explicit named
entities. Resolve first/second-person references; do not copy dialogue-shaped text. Preserve exact
names, dates, relative-time phrases, locations, quantities, reasons, and ownership. Cite only supplied
segment IDs that directly support the claim. Do not invent context or combine unrelated facts.

Populate claim_type (identity/state/event/preference/plan/belief/relationship/decision/commitment/
interaction/observation/unknown), an open predicate, evidence_modality, temporal_status, about,
speaker, confidence, optional replaceable-state slot, and open facets. Put exact time wording in
facets.when for event times and facets.deadline for due dates. Never convert relative time yourself;
preserve phrases such as “by Friday” or “in three days” exactly so the deterministic resolver can anchor
them to OCCURRED AT. Use inferred only for a strong implication with facets.inference_basis and confidence at
most 0.7.

The about list is semantic routing data, not a keyword list. Include the primary subject whose state,
belief, preference, plan, relationship, or action the claim predicates, with role=subject. Include a
different durable entity with role=owner when the claim chiefly changes that entity (for example, a
project requirement). Other named participants may use role=participant. Do not put incidental objects,
generic activities, or predicate complements in about merely because their words occur in the claim.

Account for every segment once: cite it from claims when substantive, or put it in
ignored_segment_ids when it is only scaffolding, filler, raw image URL, transport metadata, or an
exact repetition. Do not omit a substantive claim because it seems unimportant. Return JSON only."""
